# The Last Keeper

Snow caps peer over the horizon, the expanse of clouds mark the realm
of the scared ones. (Nobuyuki) Kenshin steps into the field, a daily ritual of
reverance for the land. The dew is faint at dawn, each droplet a familar friend.
He reaches down to inspect the cabbages, noticing splotches of maroon, and purple
on the leaves. His sigh feels the silence of his modest pasture, a reminder of a
world long forgotten, a space dormant for eons.
