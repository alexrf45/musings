Snow caps peer over the horizon, the expanse of clouds mark the realm
of the sacred ones. (Nobuyuki) Kenshin steps into the field, a daily ritual of
reverence for the land. The dew is faint at dawn, each droplet a familiar friend.
He reaches down to inspect the cabbages, noticing splotches of maroon and purple
on the leaves. His sigh feels the silence of his modest pasture, a reminder of a
world long forgotten, a space dormant for eons.
