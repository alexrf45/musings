Praise me, you're my sweet religion. Explore me, control me, hold me.

Fold me with bold words; unspoken desires written on my lips.

When I resist, don't insist, I long to be felt not seen.

The pressure of your intentions, hard as a diamond.

The punch of your hips against mine, an intimate engagement in the ring.

Does the dance last twelve rounds or will I tap?

You relent for a moment, my body ceases to repent. Pleasure is deliverance.

I clutch these pearls as you ascend in my sanctuary.

I'll even kneel at the altar and drink of your holy seed...

I am redeemed.
