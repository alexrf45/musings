# My Home Lab Philosophy

A home lab represents a lifetime of learning.

Problem solving in a micro way with macro implications

I strive to build things following these design principles:
**version control**, **declarative**, **transparent**

## Version control

Keep everything in version control (yes even secrets,
just make sure theyâ€™re encrypted before committing them to a repo)

Being able to revert a breaking change or reclaim an
old configuration is a game changer in the constant tinkering in a home lab.

## Declarative

- My entire configuration is defined in code.
- What's in version control is what exists.
- Manual intervention is error prone and not reproducible.

## Transparent

The code used in my lab is publicly available for anyone
to view, share or use. It encourages collaboration!
