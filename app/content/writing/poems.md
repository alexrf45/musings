# Love is

---

Love is painful,

Love is healing.

Love is grateful,

Love is simple,

Love is intricate.

Above all else, love is true.

## A letter to your heart

---

I've held you with contempt, with a reckless demand to avoid caring. A bladerunner of the worse kind
seeking to track down longings that were not my own, leaving you behind in the cold. I can't help but
wonder how you still remain so vibrant and so full of life.

No more shall I shame my hands or my intentions for you. With each beat, with each rhythm, I finally
understand it was not a heart to harm but a heart from which to learn and yearn for.

Scars remain but the lines tell a story of a path from which I retreat from more and more each day.
There is much warmth, a desire that fires my thoughts into the depths of the universe where I find you.

This is a letter to you, but a small token of gratitude ftor the soul that loves through time and space, the soul
that I love and the soul that loves me with every fiber of existence.

## The power of Four

---

Nature dances and moves with a precision of numbers, delicate angles and intricate dimensions. I count the stars
in the sky but always find there are never enough to add up to my love for you. Balance the division of logic and emotion
and see that two halves become four quarters, four seasons of waxing and waning. I count each day as another moment in the
tapestry of the universe, a love interwoven between our fingers and connected by our kiss.

Four hands and four eyes. How beautiful!
