```text
Step out of those clothes and into your dirty thoughts.

Beg from the entrance until I touch your beating heart.

Its not hard to feel so right but it's hard... and it's tight,

Can you fight it?

We grip the vibe and subscribe to a higher feeling, kneeling for the scribe,
this tongue conquers and divides.

X marks the spot, place your hand where it's hot, directions to the top,
Will you beg me to stop?

Ride the rhythm, guide your vision,
The only decision is a mission to please.

Will you finish on your knees or surrender to the length...
beneath the stars, our bodies, in sync.

```
