One day, life will be grand, sweet music from it's keys,
a melody & harmony.

One day, the joy no longer coy, ceases to be fleeting for
instead its purpose finds a higher meaning.

One day, hearts join a chorus, blending their songs,a
rhythm so strong never porous

One day, that day is today, a brighter tomorrow,
a love that is here to stay.
