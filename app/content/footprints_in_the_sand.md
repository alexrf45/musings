One pair of footprints trace a journey upon the shoreline, in search of the sunrise.

Two pairs of footprints hover near the incoming waves, as much a consequence of life as it is curiousity

Wet sand gives way to each set of footprints providing soft landing for the presence of each step.

These footprints are destined to travel a cycle of life, love, and laughter.

Each footprint left behind paints a picture of the journey started at sunrise..

Even at sunset these footprints carry on until the sun kisses the sand once more.
